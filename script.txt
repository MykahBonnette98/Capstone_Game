About me*
Im Mykah Bonnette, Ive recently discovered a passion for programming early this year.
Since starting this project I have learned how fast I can pick up new skills when im genuinely having fun.
Growing up I played a lot of video games, thats really what inspired me to make this game for my project.
I have hopes to work as a concept artist with video games and design.
